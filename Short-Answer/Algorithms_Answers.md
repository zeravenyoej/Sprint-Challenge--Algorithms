#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
0(n) As the input size increase, the time it takes to complete the algorithm increases linearly. 


b)
I do not know. It's 0(n) times something.

c) 
O(N) As the input size increase, the time it takes to complete the algorithm increases linearly. 


## Exercise II

n = size of building
e = number of eggs
f = floor number


def get_min_of_f (n, e, f)

found = false

while floor is not found:
    if
